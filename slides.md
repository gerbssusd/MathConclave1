# Full Statement
A company that makes rectangular baking pans labels each pan with the dimensions, in inches, and the capacity in quarts. A company employee needs to label a rectangular pan with dimensions 7 inches by 11 inches by 2 inches.

A pan is shown with a length of 11 inches, a width of 7 inches and a height of 2 inches.

1 quart = 57.75 cubic inches

What is the capacity, in quarts, of this pan? Round your answer to the nearest tenth.

# Rubric
(1 point) The student correctly determines that the capacity in quarts of the pan (e.g., accept 2.66 – 2.7).

# Full Statement
The $1000 prize for a lottery is to be divided evenly among the winners. Initially, there are x winners.
However, one more winner comes forward, causing each winner to receive $50 less.

Enter an equation that represents the situation and can be used to solve for x, the initial number of winners.
Enter your equation in the response box.

# Rubric
(1 point) The student creates a correct equation (e.g., 
$\frac {1000} {x}-50=\frac {1000} {z+1}$ )

# Full Statement
A restaurant serves a vegetarian and a chicken lunch special each day. Each vegetarian special is the same price.

Each chicken special is the same price. However, the price of the vegetarian special is different from the price of the chicken special.

On Thursday, the restaurant collected $467 selling 21 vegetarian specials and 40 chicken specials.
On Friday, the restaurant collected $484 selling 28 vegetarian specials and 36 chicken specials.
Enter the cost, in dollars, of the vegetarian lunch special.

# Rubric
(1 point) The student correctly determines the cost of the vegetarian special (7).

# Full Statement
Susan has an ear infection. Her doctor prescribes an antibiotic. The doctor tells Susan to take a 250-milligram dose of the antibiotic every 12 hours for the next 10 days.
- Susan finds out that 4% of the antibiotic is still in her body after 12 hours.
- Assume that each dose is exactly 250 milligrams and that Susan takes one dose every 12 hours.
  - *Part A:* How much of the antibiotic, in milligrams, is in Susan’s body immediately after taking the 2nd dose? Enter your answer in the first response box.
  - *Part B:* How much of the antibiotic, in milligrams, is in Susan’s body immediately after taking the 10th dose? Enter your answer in the second response box.
# Rubric
(2 points) The student enters the correct amount of antibiotic in Susan’s body for Part A and B (e.g., 260, 260.4167). Note: An acceptable range for Part B is 260.4-260.422. (1 point) The student enters the correct amount for Part A or Part B, but not both.

Two water tanks are shown. Tank A is a rectangular prism and Tank B is a cylinder. The tanks are not drawn to scale.

- Tank A is filled with water to the 10-meter mark.

- Half of the water from Tank A is poured into Tank B. The water level on Tank A drops to 5 meters and the water level on Tank B becomes 4 meters.

Find the radius of Tank B, rounded to the nearest meter. Enter Your answer in the response box.


# Rubric
(1 point). The student enters the correct radius in the response box (5).
